## üöÄ Problem Statement

Customer churn is a major problem in industries like telecom, where retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project aims to:

- Identify patterns leading to customer churn.
- Predict churn using historical data.
- Provide actionable insights for business decision-making.

## üìä Project Workflow

1. **Data Exploration & Visualization (EDA):**
   - Univariate & bivariate analysis (e.g., gender, tenure, contract type).
   - Correlation heatmaps & churn distribution.
2. **Preprocessing:**
   - Categorical encoding (Label, One-Hot).
   - Feature scaling.
   - Saving encoders & scalers for reuse.
3. **Modeling:**
   - Hyperparameter tuning via `GridSearchCV`.
   - ANN built using TensorFlow/Keras.
   - EarlyStopping & TensorBoard for evaluation.
4. **Evaluation:**
   - Confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
   - ROC-AUC curve.
5. **Deployment:**
   - Deployed via a **Streamlit app** for interactive predictions.
